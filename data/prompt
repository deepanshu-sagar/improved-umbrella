I have a Python project file that needs improvement. I require your assistance to optimize its performance and integrate Python best practices. Please go through the code and suggest updates where necessary. Make sure the code complies with Python coding conventions such as those checked by tools like Pylint, pep8 and include elements of well-structured and optimized Python code. Moreover, the updated file should reflect an avoidance of common Python coding pitfalls. Finally, the optimized file should serve as a resource for improved Python coding, particularly in the context of file updating and code optimization. After your input, I will proceed to update the file. only the code is required a an input. make sure to dont outout any text with is not port of the python code. Make sure to add necessarty consise doc strings for as per pep8 standarads. Also make sure to NOT add any explanations ONLY CODE is required. Also make sure to NOT add any explanations ONLY CODE is required. Make sure to remove all commented lines. Make sure to make the code pretty to read as well.
